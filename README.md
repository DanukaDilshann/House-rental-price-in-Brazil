- Research Questions:
  - <a href="a"> Do property taxes relate to the area?</a>

## General Discussion and conclusions

- There is a positive relationship between the area of a property and its property taxes. Larger properties tend to have higher property taxes.

- Furnished houses generally have higher fire insurance values. This indicates that fire insurance costs are related to whether a house is furnished or not.

- Property taxes vary significantly across different cities in Brazil. Some cities impose higher property tax rates, while others have lower rates.

- Fire insurance costs also vary by city. Cities that frequently experience forest fires tend to have higher fire insurance premiums. Specifically, in our case, citizens of S√£o Paulo pay higher fire insurance premiums compared to residents of other cities.

- The rental price of a house is influenced by whether pets are allowed. If house owners permit pets, the rent amount tends to be higher. Therefore, the rent amount is related to the policy on keeping animals.
